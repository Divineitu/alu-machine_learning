# Plotting

## Project Overview

This project introduces data visualization using **Matplotlib**, a widely used plotting library in Python.  
The goal is to understand how numerical data can be represented graphically using different types of plots, such as line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and bar charts.

## Technologies Used

**Python 3.5**
**NumPy 1.15**
**Matplotlib 3.0**

## File Descriptions

**0-line.py**

Plots a cubic function as a solid red line with a specified x-axis range.

**1-scatter.py**

Creates a scatter plot showing the relationship between height and weight.

**2-change_scale.py**

Plots an exponential decay function using a logarithmic y-axis scale.

**3-two.py**

Displays two line graphs on the same plot, comparing radioactive decay rates with a legend.

**4-frequency.py**

Generates a histogram representing the frequency distribution of student grades.

**5-all_in_one.py**

Combines the previous plots into a single figure using a 3×2 grid layout.

**6-bars.py**

Creates a stacked bar chart representing quantities of different fruits owned by individuals.
